## Project Description

This web application utilizes React, Python Flask, and the visx graphic library to provide visual insights into how the public debate around controversial educational topics has fluctuated throughout history.

Due to limitations with traditional news data sources, I creatively leveraged Google's Gemini AI to generate relevance scores with historical context.

## Key Insights

    Controversial educational topics often follow cyclical patterns of relevance.
    Debates like those surrounding evolution and sex education have persisted for much longer than many realize.

## Features

    Radial line chart visualizing the relevance of selected topics over time.
    AI-generated relevance scores with explanatory context.

## Technical Details

    Frontend: React
    Backend: Python Flask
    AI: Google Gemini
    Visualization: visx
